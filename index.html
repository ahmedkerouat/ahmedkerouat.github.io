        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Ahmed Kerouat.</p>
        <p>I consider my self as an artist, a developer and a leader.</p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am a senior at Lyc√©e Louis Pasteur Tunis, where I
          specialize in Mathematics and Physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my academic endeavors, I indulge in various hobbies.
          Skateboarding, drawing, and engaging in Valorant gaming sessions are
          some of my favorite pastimes. My early creative journey revolved
          around drawing, which I began at the age of 3 or 4, like all the other
          kids. However, at the age of 10, I delved into Photoshop and 3D
          softwares, marking the formal start of my digital creative journey.
          Since then, I've undertaken numerous projects in these domains. At the
          age of 13, I ventured into the world of coding, which has become a
          persistent passion in my life.

        <h3>Why a Gas Mask ?</h3>
        <p>
          In my artwork and on the Internet I like to depict myself using a gas
          mask. Because it's not who I am that matters, it's the reflection of
          my actions and my philosophy that hold a significance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our world grapples with numerous issues today, I harness the power of
          art to criticize society and address these problems. In most of my
          work, I aim to evoke strong emotions, intending to shock and, in turn,
          inspire thoughts and actions. "Anyone can wear the mask" - Miles
          Morales

        <h2>Notable Projects:</h2>
        <p>
          During High school, I had the opportunity to work on multitude of
          coding projects. But here are the most notable ones, each of which
          likely took several months.

              Inspired by a mini-game in Minecraft called BedWars, where the

              This project utilizes a sophisticated sphere packing technique to
              simulate all 118 elements based on the Bohr Model. It provides
              detailed electron configuration information generated in the code
              for rendering and allows you to manipulate atom stability.
              Additionally, it features a camera for enhanced interaction.
