        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>My name is Ahmed Kerouat.</p>
        <p>I consider my self as an artist, a developer and a leader.</p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am a senior at Lyc√©e Louis Pasteur Tunis, where I
          specialize in Mathematics and Physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of my academic endeavors, I indulge in various hobbies.
          Skateboarding, drawing, and engaging in Valorant gaming sessions are
          some of my favorite pastimes. My early creative journey revolved
          around drawing, which I began at the age of 3 or 4, like all the other
          kids. However, at the age of 10, I delved into Photoshop and 3D
          softwares, marking the formal start of my digital creative journey.
          Since then, I've undertaken numerous projects in these domains. At the
          age of 13, I ventured into the world of coding, which has become a
          persistent passion in my life.

        <h3>Why a Gas Mask ?</h2>
        <p>
          In my artwork and on the Internet I like to depict myself using a gas
          mask. Because it's not who I am that matters, it's the reflection of
          my actions and my philosophy that hold a significance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our world grapples with numerous issues today, I harness the power of
          art to criticize society and address these problems. In most of my
          work, I aim to evoke strong emotions, intending to shock and, in turn,
          inspire thoughts and actions. "Anyone can wear the mask" - Miles
          Morales
